He still might need to brace for trouble.\u00c2\u00a0</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>As he thinks through what to do next, Adedoyin is thankful a chunk of his money is stored in bitcoin. His crypto wallet is in a hiding spot the officers probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think to check. That means they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re less likely to steal it.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Police corruption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-option-expirations-defi\">Market Wrap: Bitcoin Braces for $700M in Options to Expire; Record $7B Value Locked in DeFi</a></p>\n<p>While there are many principled police officers in Nigeria who help tackle crimes, police corruption is pervasive. Many Nigerian police are known for extorting and even sometimes torturing citizens rather than helping them solve legal quandaries.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight there in the bathroom, where I was in my boxers with just my phone, AirPods and pack of cigarettes, I could hear them shouting for me to come open the door,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Adedoyin told CoinDesk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nigerians-push-end-police-brutality-after-global-george-floyd-protests-n1237629\">well-documented phenomenon</a> in Nigeria. Over the past several years, an online social media movement has emerged against the police. On Twitter, people use the hashtag #EndSARS to publicize the poor treatment they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve received from police. SARS stands for Special Anti-Robbery Squad, which is a particularly brutal and mistrusted wing of the Nigerian police force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human rights research organization Human Rights Watch released a 102-page<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/08/17/nigeria-corruption-fueling-police-abuses\"> report</a> outlining the abuses in painful detail in 2010.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cHuman Rights Watch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research revealed that people refusing to pay bribes are routinely subjected to arbitrary arrest, unlawful detention and threats until they or their family members negotiate payment for their release. Extortion-related confrontations between the police and motorists often escalate into more serious abuses. The evidence suggests that police officers have on numerous occasions severely beaten, sexually assaulted, or shot to death ordinary citizens who failed to pay the bribes demanded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the report reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tricks and strategies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adedoyin notes that Nigerians have to develop their own tricks to avoid police extortion, especially the younger Nigerians who are the main targets. Some people walk along different routes to avoid walking near the police.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to each person to prevent oneself from entering such situations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The practice is common enough that Adedoyin has been extorted by police officers more than once, and his friends have, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corrupt police officers take their detainee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phone. They <a href=\"https://guardian.ng/news/victim-narrates-how-policemen-extorted-n300000-from-them-at-gunpoint/\">scan through it</a> looking for SMS or email messages signalling how much money the detainee has in the bank.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the police officer finds the detainee doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any money, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re less likely to waste their time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Locked in the bathroom, Adedoyin rapidly scrolls through his most recent messages, deleting any bank statements or emails showing how much money he has.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The bathroom door lock breaks.\u00c2\u00a0</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adedoyin is confronted by four police officers, all carrying guns. One slaps Adedoyin and asks him why he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come open the door. As Adedoyin expected, another officer snatches his phone and scans through for any grain of evidence that Adedoyin has money.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adedoyin didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time to delete everything. The officer finds some evidence of how much money he makes. They finally let him go once he pays.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where using bitcoin comes in</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a bad experience. But Adedoyin is happy that his <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a> trick worked <em>\u00e2\u0080\u0093</em> most of his money is still safe.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe money they collected to let me go in that case would have been a lot more if I had more money in my account. But I had most of my money in bitcoin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Adedoyin said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why does using bitcoin help in this situation? Adedoyin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ploy is to pretend that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much money to extort. His solution is to store his money in a bitcoin wallet instead of in a bricks-and-mortar bank. Since bitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less common, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less likely the police officers find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put another way, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not putting his money into bitcoin as a safeguard because of its decentralization properties. Rather, he just thinks police officers are far less likely to look for a crypto balance than a fiat balance to see if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ripe for extortion.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009c[The officers] don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think to check [bitcoin] wallet apps, because most of them don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know what bitcoin is and even think bitcoin is a scam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Adedoyin said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second reason he has bitcoin is he hopes the price will keep rising. Like many other bitcoiners in the region, he sees it as an investment that might pay off in the future.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for now, he keeps most of his money in bitcoin as security against the next time the police come banging on his door.</p>\n<h2>Related Stories</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-drop-weak-derivatives-long-positions-price-bitmex\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin Drop Squeezes Out Weak Derivatives Positions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 And That May Be a Good Thing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-ether-mining\" target=\"_blank\">Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dips to $11.1K; Ether Mining Difficulty at Year High</a></li>\n</ul>",

As of the last reading, the central bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferred measure of consumer price increases registered just 0.9%, so the baseline expectation is the Fed would let inflation rise well above 2% so that the average over a long period of time gets closer to the target.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-risks-drop-dollar-rebounds\">Bitcoin Risks Deeper Drop if Dollar Rebounds</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us be optimistic and say it takes three years to create some inflation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matt Blom, head of sales and trading at the digital-asset firm Diginex, wrote Wednesday in an email. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would need to drive it above 3.5% and maintain it there for years before we are able to use an average calculation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear what Fed scenario is already priced into the market, but Bank of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Athanasios Vamvakidis, a foreign-exchange analyst, wrote that there is \u00e2\u0080\u009cno easy way out\u00e2\u0080\u009d for Powell and his colleagues.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout inflation eventually acting as a budget constraint, we see risks for recurring and worsening bubbles, with further divergence between Wall Street and Main Street,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vamvakidis wrote.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Powell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech could say about the dollar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto traders will focus in the short term on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherbrookins/2020/08/25/fed-actions-are-unlikely-to-boost-bitcoin-in-the-near-term/?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=93936616&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tP5DzED7SOY7JMPnb83ugO-FdHAFntf_AQLnzgDQnz7ar9c1DF9RTebnpsbAakN3dUzJI4pphtMHqk9pM9NBre2CwRg&utm_content=93936616&utm_source=hs_email#6a54f0c60f88\">what the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech might mean for bitcoin prices</a>, which have surged almost 60% in 2020, far exceeding this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 7.7%<strong> </strong>year-to-date gain in the Standard & Poor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 500 Index of U.S. stocks.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions could also have implications for <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum\">ether</a>, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, where entrepreneurs are developing alternative currencies and semi-autonomous lending and trading networks that might one day replace the current financial system.

One is Thursday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe key thing to watch from Powell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech tomorrow is the possible shift of the inflation target from a unique figure, like 2%, to a range such as 1.75%-2.25%,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis would create a dovish feel to the market and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d likely see some dollar weakness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/fed-powell-jackson-hole-us-dollar\">Fed Chair Powell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jackson Hole Speech Could Hint at US Dollar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Future</a></p>\n<p>Another event is the expiration of 65,000 BTC options, over $700 million at current market values, on Friday. The vast majority of these options are on crypto derivatives platform Deribit.\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe may see some volatility as a few traders try to push the futures market towards the $11,000 or $12,000 strike,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Swissquote\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Thomas, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009c$11,000 would be a buying opportunity and $12,000 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d likely see further selling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read More: </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/fidelitys-chief-strategist-starts-bitcoin-index-fund\"><strong><em>Fidelity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chief Strategist Starts Bitcoin Index Fund</em></strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Value locked in DeFi at $7B </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ether (<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum\">ETH</a>), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $386 and climbing 1.4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read More: </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/bitgo-wbtc-ethereum-fees\"><strong><em>BitGo Weighs Building a Sidechain for WBTC as Ethereum Fees Climb</em></strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The total value locked in decentralized finance, or DeFi, has surpassed $7 billion in value, according to aggregator DeFi Pulse.

The document released Wednesday states:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not expect that number of newly eligible individual accredited investors to be significant compared to the number of individual investors that currently are eligible to participate in private offerings, and (2) we expect the amount of capital invested by such newly eligible individual investors to have minimal effects on the private offering market generally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The document indicates that only individuals with <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/registration-exams-ce/qualification-exams/series7\">Series 7</a>, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series65.asp\">65</a> or <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/registration-exams-ce/qualification-exams/series82\">82</a> certifications would qualify for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hinkes said the move is still promising, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe modernization reflects the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willingness to continue to consider further expansion of the definition to include other certifications or credentials and includes an invitation for the public to offer suggestions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hinkes told CoinDesk on Wednesday.</p>\n<h2>Related Stories</h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/interactive-rokers-to-pay-38m-in-settlement-with-regulators-over-aml-apses\" target=\"_blank\">Interactive Brokers to Pay $38M in Settlement Over AML Lapses</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/sec-smart-contract-tracing-tool\" target=\"_blank\">SEC Seeking \u00e2\u0080\u0098Smart Contract\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tracing Tool That Can Spot Security Vulnerabilities</a></li>\n</ul>",
