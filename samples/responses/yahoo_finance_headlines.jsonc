    "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders prohibiting U.S. residents from doing business with the Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat apps beginning 45 days from now, citing the national security risk of leaving Americans\u2019 personal data exposed.The bans mark a significant escalation by Trump in his confrontation with Beijing as the U.S. seeks to curb China\u2019s power in global technology. With the U.S. election less than 90 days away, Trump is making his challenge of China a central theme of his campaign, where he trails Democrat Joe Biden in the polls.Shares of WeChat\u2019s owner, China\u2019s Tencent Holdings Ltd., fell as much as 10% in morning trading. The offshore yuan weakened as much as 0.40%, the most since July 22, to 6.971 a dollar.\u201cThis is yet another watershed moment in the U.S.-China technology cold war here where the U.S. government is targeting these two very popular Chinese apps and basically saying they have national security problems,\u201d said Paul Triolo, Head of Global Technology policy at Eurasia Group. \u201cIt shows the depth of the U.S. concern.\u201dThe move coincides with Trump\u2019s push for the sale of TikTok, the popular video app owned by ByteDance Ltd., to an American company, and it comes a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo urged U.S. businesses to remove the two Chinese apps from their stores. It threatens penalties on any U.S. resident or company that conducts transactions with TikTok, WeChat or their owners after the orders take effect.\u201cTo protect our Nation, I took action to address the threat posed by one mobile application, TikTok. Further action is needed to address a similar threat posed by another mobile application, WeChat,\u201d Trump said in the order against WeChat, released minutes after the TikTok measure.Earlier this week, Trump threatened to shut down TikTok if its owners didn\u2019t sell the business to a U.S. company by Sept. 15. Microsoft Corp. has been in talks about a possible purchase of TikTok, an app that\u2019s been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally and more than 165 million times in the U.S. The software company is focused on buying the app\u2019s operations in the U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand.Tencent declined to comment. TikTok representatives didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.The order against TikTok blocks all transactions in which its owner, ByteDance, or subsidiaries have an interest, according to a U.S. official. The measure against WeChat blocks all transactions involving the app but it doesn\u2019t amount to a broader banon dealings with its owner, Tencent, the official said.The measure would apply to any transaction over which the U.S. could have jurisdiction, and sanctions would be defined by the U.S. Commerce Secretary, according to a Trump administration official, who discussed the order on condition of anonymity.Transactions subject to punishment could include purchases of ads on the apps and agreements to make TikTok or WeChat available in app stores, according to a person familiar with the matter, who discussed the orders on condition of anonymity. Simply downloading the apps could be affected, since that involves accepting terms of service that include an intellectual property agreement between the user and app developer, the person said.WeChat, the messaging software developed by Tencent, has evolved into an all-purpose app that allows people to use it for payments, e-commerce and more. The app is one of the most popular in the world with more than 1 billion users, and U.S. companies like Starbucks Corp., for example, use the service with consumers in China.Tencent is one of China\u2019s most valuable tech companies, and its Chief Executive Officer Pony Ma is among the many business leaders who serves as a delegate to the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament.Trump made his move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law that allows the president to declare a national emergency in response to an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat,\u201d allowing him to block transactions and seize assets.\u201cIEEPA is an incredibly expansive authority and allows the president to declare a national emergency with respect to just about anything,\u201d Brian Fleming, a lawyer at Miller & Chevalier in Washington who previously worked in the Justice Department\u2019s national security division. \u201cA legal challenge on the grounds that IEEPA does not provide the President authority to act with regard to something deemed to be a national security emergency would have a very low likelihood of success.\u201dIn his TikTok order, Trump said the app \u201cautomatically captures vast swaths\u201d of user data, including location information and browsing history.\u201cThis data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information -- potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage,\u201d Trump said.TikTok says American user data is stored in servers in the U.S. and Singapore, not China. But TikTok\u2019s terms of service stipulate that the company may share information with its parent, subsidiary or other affiliates. Previous versions of its privacy policy warned users it could exchange information with its Chinese businesses, law enforcement agencies and public authorities, if legally required to do so.Banning WeChat in the U.S. could have far greater implications to cross-border business between Chinese and American companies, impacting everything from the manufacturing of medical face masks and Apple iPhones to the inking contracts of lawyers and bankers.While WeChat is not popular in the U.S. as a consumer messaging tool, the messaging app isn\u2019t just used to chat with friends and family.In China, it\u2019s virtually impossible to function without Wechat and is essentially used by businesses in the place of email and text messages, which are not used as widely in China as they are in the U.S. Other messaging apps like Facebook Inc.-owned Whatsapp are blocked in China, making it harder to communicate with overseas partners without WeChat.\u201cA ban on WeChat would be consequential because it would practically shut down communication between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Graham Webster, China Digital Economy Fellow at think tank New America. \u201cThere are real data, privacy, and security concerns but they go well beyond these two Chinese apps and these orders just wrap the real issues up in political theatre.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co.\u2019s profit blew past all estimates after Animal Crossing sales almost doubled and supply shocks eased, suggesting the Switch console will hold up well against new competition in the coming holidays. Shares rose.The Japanese company has already asked assemblers to increase production of its marquee gaming console yet again in order to keep up with demand, Bloomberg News reported earlier. It registered a five-fold leap in operating profit to 145 billion yen ($1.4 billion) over the last quarter, its best performance for the April-June period ever. Sales of the Switch and newer Switch Lite console rose past 5 million units.Read more: Nintendo Is Said to Hike Switch Target Again to Sate Gaming BoomThat performance was driven by island life simulator Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which got off to a hot start in March with nearly 12 million copies sold in its first 11 days. The game sold another 10.6 million units in the latest quarter -- about half of them via digital download -- and is close to becoming the best-selling Switch title of all time. Nintendo said that more than half of new Switch owners over the last three months played Animal Crossing first.\u200bThe Kyoto-based company said that while there\u2019s still a lag time in restocking store shelves, its production bottleneck for the Switch will soon be resolved. The company added that it plans to ramp up production closer to the holiday shopping season to ensure adequate supply.\u201cWe did not change our fiscal-year forecast because it\u2019s too soon to judge how long the current Animal Crossing sales momentum would last,\u201d a Nintendo spokesman said. \u201cWe would like to wait until the year-end shopping season\u2019s performance to check whether we need to revise our forecast.\u201dNintendo shares gained as much as 4.6% in Tokyo trading, the most on an intraday basis since March.Though Nintendo suffered some supply and shipping issues from the coronavirus outbreak, the company has mostly experienced a strong tailwind that\u2019s affected the entire games industry as people spend more time at home to avoid spreading infection. This trend is likely to last throughout the year, according to Hideki Yasuda of Ace Research Institute, who anticipates accelerating sales of both hardware and software for Nintendo -- especially the lucrative digital downloads -- as the calendar moves toward the holiday shopping season.\u201cSelling 50 million software units outside of a holiday quarter is unheard of and they saw much bigger digital downloads, both probably benefiting from social distancing,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Kanterman.On Wednesday, the company announced Pikmin 3 Deluxe for release at the end of October, partially addressing concern about its ability to sustain momentum through the holiday sales period that\u2019s likely to be dominated by next-generation consoles and a slate of new titles from Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. Sony this week reported earnings far above expectations and set a new high for PlayStation Plus subscriber additions in the quarter, mirroring Nintendo\u2019s strong results.\u201cThe operating profit was shocking enough to make us believe there was a Christmas somewhere on this planet during the quarter,\u201d Ace Research Institute\u2019s Yasuda said. \u201cWe want to see one or two more titles added for the Switch if we\u2019re to expect Nintendo\u2019s fiscal-year software sales to overwhelm the current company forecast.\u201d(Updates with share trading from first paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

Trump has said TikTok will have to close down in the U.S. by Sept. 15 unless a deal can be reached to sell the domestic assets to an American company. Microsoft has been the only firm to publicly declare it is in active discussions with ByteDance over TikTok.Cleaving just the U.S. operations off a global app would be particularly challenging. The Financial Times said one reason Microsoft is considering buying the whole operation instead has to do with the difficulty of separating back-office functions and ensuring that people would still be able to use the app when traveling between countries.One person familiar with the White House\u2019s discussions of TikTok has said its global business would be worth about $50 billion, with its U.S. operations valued at less than that.
