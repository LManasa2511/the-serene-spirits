Creative Subscriptions revenue came in at $190.2M, up 21% year-over-year, with Business Solutions revenue of $45.9M, up 62% year-over-year.Lior Shemesh, CFO of Wix referred to an \u2018immense uplift in demand\u2019 in recent months, driven by the rapidly increasing importance of having an online presence.\u201cWe are responding to this continued heightened demand by increasing our investment in marketing, which based on our historical data, will drive continued collections and revenue growth in the near future\u201d he stated.Indeed, WIX added a record 9.3M users (up 18% year-over-year) and 346,000 net premium subscriptions (up 17%) in the second quarter, with users purchasing Business and eCommerce subscription packages and annual and multi-year packages at a higher frequency.The company also revealed that it is expecting revenue growth of 26-27% year-over-year and collections growth of 31-34% year-over-year in the third quarter. That\u2019s alongside free cash flow\u00a0of $16-18M (down 38-45%).\u201cWix is taking market share during the pandemic with 50% of users coming to Wix with a domain registered elsewhere, and the company continued to lean in on marketing spend in Q2\u201d comments RBC Capital analyst\u00a0Mark Mahaney.He thinks Revenue could potentially accelerate in H2 with the sustained momentum for Digital Presence and the launch of Editor X in July expanding Wix\u2019s Agency opportunity. Indeed, Wix is trying to beef up its e-Commerce capabilities to close the gap with competitors like SHOP.As a result, the analyst has a buy rating on the stock with a $350 price target. Despite shares having more than doubled year-to-date Mahaney\u2019s price target indicates further upside potential still lies ahead. (See WIX stock analysis on TipRanks).Overall WIX scores a bullish Strong Buy consensus from the Street although the average analyst\u00a0price target\u00a0indicates that shares will continue to pull back from current levels.Related News:  Zimmer Biomet Slips 3.7% On 2Q Profit Decline  Roku Tops 2Q Estimates But Cautions About Ad Outlook  3D Systems Drops 7% In After-Hours On Wider-Than-Expected 2Q Loss More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Live Nation 2Q Loss Widens; Shares Decline   * Barclays Upgrades Wayfair, Lifts PT After 2Q Sales Beat   * Bausch Health To Spin Off Eye Care Business; Shares Surge 18%   * WDC Sinks 11% In Pre-Market On Earnings Outlook Miss<p><br clear=\"all\">",

Creative Subscriptions revenue came in at $190.2M, up 21% year-over-year, with Business Solutions revenue of $45.9M, up 62% year-over-year.Lior Shemesh, CFO of Wix referred to an \u2018immense uplift in demand\u2019 in recent months, driven by the rapidly increasing importance of having an online presence.\u201cWe are responding to this continued heightened demand by increasing our investment in marketing, which based on our historical data, will drive continued collections and revenue growth in the near future\u201d he stated.Indeed, WIX added a record 9.3M users (up 18% year-over-year) and 346,000 net premium subscriptions (up 17%) in the second quarter, with users purchasing Business and eCommerce subscription packages and annual and multi-year packages at a higher frequency.The company also revealed that it is expecting revenue growth of 26-27% year-over-year and collections growth of 31-34% year-over-year in the third quarter. That\u2019s alongside free cash flow\u00a0of $16-18M (down 38-45%).\u201cWix is taking market share during the pandemic with 50% of users coming to Wix with a domain registered elsewhere, and the company continued to lean in on marketing spend in Q2\u201d comments RBC Capital analyst\u00a0Mark Mahaney.He thinks Revenue could potentially accelerate in H2 with the sustained momentum for Digital Presence and the launch of Editor X in July expanding Wix\u2019s Agency opportunity. Indeed, Wix is trying to beef up its e-Commerce capabilities to close the gap with competitors like SHOP.As a result, the analyst has a buy rating on the stock with a $350 price target. Despite shares having more than doubled year-to-date Mahaney\u2019s price target indicates further upside potential still lies ahead. (See WIX stock analysis on TipRanks).Overall WIX scores a bullish Strong Buy consensus from the Street although the average analyst\u00a0price target\u00a0indicates that shares will continue to pull back from current levels.Related News:  Zimmer Biomet Slips 3.7% On 2Q Profit Decline  Roku Tops 2Q Estimates But Cautions About Ad Outlook  3D Systems Drops 7% In After-Hours On Wider-Than-Expected 2Q Loss More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Live Nation 2Q Loss Widens; Shares Decline   * Barclays Upgrades Wayfair, Lifts PT After 2Q Sales Beat   * Bausch Health To Spin Off Eye Care Business; Shares Surge 18%   * WDC Sinks 11% In Pre-Market On Earnings Outlook Miss<p><br clear=\"all\">",

Gilbert owns an estimated 73% of the firm.His net worth is more than four times the previous estimate on the Bloomberg index. It means he\u2019s now the 28th-richest person on the planet, ahead of Blackstone Group Inc.\u2019s Stephen Schwarzman, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and cosmetics titan Leonard Lauder.Julia Sahin, a spokeswoman for Rocket Cos., declined to comment.Quicken Loans is the bedrock of Gilbert\u2019s wealth. It\u2019s the largest retail mortgage originator in the U.S., underwriting about $145 billion in 2019. That powered the company to $892 million in net income in 2019. This year -- despite a pandemic -- origination volumes hit a record in March, April, May and June with falling rates encouraging homeowners to refinance. And those rates keep dropping. The average for a 30-year fixed loan fell to 2.88%, the lowest in nearly 50 years of record keeping by Freddie Mac.Assembly Line\u201cQuicken was able to create an assembly line for mortgage banking,\u201d said Les Parker, managing director of consulting firm Transformational Mortgage Solutions.The specialization of every step in the lending process allowed it to process loans more efficiently, at lower cost, than banks.The company will have to contend with a mixed tracked record for retail lenders that have gone public, Parker said, with the cyclical nature of the industry making sustained growth difficult. Rocket\u2019s diminished listing came after investors pushed back on the company\u2019s valuation, arguing it should be priced as a consumer or financial company rather than a technology business, a person familiar with the matter said.Pizza DeliveryGilbert was born in a Detroit suburb. A law student, he parlayed his earnings from delivering pizzas to set up lender Rock Financial in 1985, according to a 1998 prospectus. He later started direct mortgage lender Rockloans.com.This won\u2019t be Quicken\u2019s first experience as a public company. Rock Financial was bought by software maker Intuit in 1999, and renamed Quicken Loans. Gilbert bought the company back three years later when its annual mortgage originations stood at $7 billion. Low interest rates in the aftermath of the global financial crisis helped supercharge Quicken\u2019s growth and it became the nation\u2019s largest retail lender in 2017.With his company prospering as a private entity, Gilbert\u2019s profile rose. He acquired the majority ownership of Cleveland\u2019s National Basketball Association team in 2005 and bought up dozens of buildings in downtown Detroit during the last recession in a bid to revitalize Motor City. Other prized assets -- such as the Cavaliers basketball franchise and real estate investment firm Bedrock -- are held outside the newly listed entity.Christopher Leinberger, a research professor at the GW School of Business, part of George Washington University, estimates that these investments resulted in about $18 billion of increased economic activity for the city.\u201cWho in his right mind would invest in 100 buildings in Detroit in 2010?\u201d Leinberger said, adding that the gamble ultimately worked. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be headlines about how downtown Detroit is back without Gilbert.\u201dPerfect BracketGilbert also developed a rapport with another Midwestern billionaire.When Quicken\u2019s marketing team offered a $1 billion prize to a contestant who predicted the winner of each game in the National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s men\u2019s basketball tournament in 2014, Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. insured the payout.The calculated gamble paid off: no one won but the prize drew plenty of attention to Quicken. The two also teamed up for an unsuccessful bid for Yahoo in 2016, the same year the Cavs won their first-ever championship.While its been nearly two decades since Gilbert stepped back as Quicken\u2019s chief executive officer, the company still bears his imprint. The IPO filing highlights core principals Gilbert espoused like \u201cIgnore the noise,\u201d and \u201cEvery second counts.\u201dHis continuing influence was underlined when he had a stroke in 2019, news of which sent shockwaves through his companies and hometown.He\u2019s since been able to return to work and there\u2019s little indication he\u2019s planning to relinquish control anytime soon.

As the companies developing vaccine/therapeutics move further down the development path, the commercial aspect is starting to take a more prominent part in the conversation.mRNA vaccine maker Moderna (MRNA) is one of the companies currently leading the pack, but it needs to be vigilant of rivals\u2019 progress. Shares of Moderna hit a speed bump on Wednesday and trended downwards on account of positive developments in the progress of rivals Novavax (NVAX) and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) respective COVID-19 vaccine programs.Novavax\u2019 candidate NVX-CoV2373 performed well in a phase 1 study and drew positive responses from several Street analysts. While J&J\u2019s pricing ($10 per dose in its deal with the U.S. government) might put pressure on Moderna to significantly reduce the $32 to $37 per dose price range its small volume deals have bought in so far for mRNA-1273, its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Nevertheless, so far, Moderna\u2019s candidate is making its way smoothly through the clinical trial process.And that is where the key focus lies. Should the company report positive data from the recently initiated Phase 3 mRNA-1273 trial, then the rules of the game will change in its favor. This is a point picked by Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh. The 5-star analyst believes Moderna is well positioned to build on the several agreements it has already made to supply $400 million\u2019s worth of the potential vaccine.Singh opined \u201cAs the global community now sets its sights on potential late-stage COVID-19 vaccine data over the coming quarters, a greater share of the conversation has shifted toward commercialization and pricing\u2026 While MRNA navigates vaccine supply agreements and a potential commercialization of mRNA-1273, we anticipate volatility in the shares to continue. Nonetheless, clinical updates from P2 and eventually P3, in parallel with a further clarified regulatory path to approval, position MRNA well over the coming 12-18 months, in our view.\u201dAccordingly, Singh keeps his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating as is, along with a $108 price target. What does it mean for investors? Upside potential of 47% from current levels.

With the U.S. election less than 90 days away, Trump is making his challenge of China a central theme of his campaign, where he trails Democrat Joe Biden in the polls.Shares of WeChat\u2019s owner, China\u2019s Tencent Holdings Ltd., fell as much as 10% in morning trading. The offshore yuan weakened as much as 0.40%, the most since July 22, to 6.971 a dollar.\u201cThis is yet another watershed moment in the U.S.-China technology cold war here where the U.S. government is targeting these two very popular Chinese apps and basically saying they have national security problems,\u201d said Paul Triolo, Head of Global Technology policy at Eurasia Group. \u201cIt shows the depth of the U.S. concern.\u201dThe move coincides with Trump\u2019s push for the sale of TikTok, the popular video app owned by ByteDance Ltd., to an American company, and it comes a day after Secretary of State Michael Pompeo urged U.S. businesses to remove the two Chinese apps from their stores. It threatens penalties on any U.S. resident or company that conducts transactions with TikTok, WeChat or their owners after the orders take effect.\u201cTo protect our Nation, I took action to address the threat posed by one mobile application, TikTok. Further action is needed to address a similar threat posed by another mobile application, WeChat,\u201d Trump said in the order against WeChat, released minutes after the TikTok measure.Earlier this week, Trump threatened to shut down TikTok if its owners didn\u2019t sell the business to a U.S. company by Sept. 15. Microsoft Corp. has been in talks about a possible purchase of TikTok, an app that\u2019s been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally and more than 165 million times in the U.S. The software company is focused on buying the app\u2019s operations in the U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand.Tencent declined to comment. TikTok representatives didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.The order against TikTok blocks all transactions in which its owner, ByteDance, or subsidiaries have an interest, according to a U.S. official. The measure against WeChat blocks all transactions involving the app but it doesn\u2019t amount to a broader banon dealings with its owner, Tencent, the official said.The measure would apply to any transaction over which the U.S. could have jurisdiction, and sanctions would be defined by the U.S. Commerce Secretary, according to a Trump administration official, who discussed the order on condition of anonymity.Transactions subject to punishment could include purchases of ads on the apps and agreements to make TikTok or WeChat available in app stores, according to a person familiar with the matter, who discussed the orders on condition of anonymity. Simply downloading the apps could be affected, since that involves accepting terms of service that include an intellectual property agreement between the user and app developer, the person said.WeChat, the messaging software developed by Tencent, has evolved into an all-purpose app that allows people to use it for payments, e-commerce and more. The app is one of the most popular in the world with more than 1 billion users, and U.S. companies like Starbucks Corp., for example, use the service with consumers in China.Tencent is one of China\u2019s most valuable tech companies, and its Chief Executive Officer Pony Ma is among the many business leaders who serves as a delegate to the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament.Trump made his move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law that allows the president to declare a national emergency in response to an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat,\u201d allowing him to block transactions and seize assets.\u201cIEEPA is an incredibly expansive authority and allows the president to declare a national emergency with respect to just about anything,\u201d Brian Fleming, a lawyer at Miller & Chevalier in Washington who previously worked in the Justice Department\u2019s national security division. \u201cA legal challenge on the grounds that IEEPA does not provide the President authority to act with regard to something deemed to be a national security emergency would have a very low likelihood of success.\u201dIn his TikTok order, Trump said the app \u201cautomatically captures vast swaths\u201d of user data, including location information and browsing history.\u201cThis data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information -- potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage,\u201d Trump said.TikTok says American user data is stored in servers in the U.S. and Singapore, not China. But TikTok\u2019s terms of service stipulate that the company may share information with its parent, subsidiary or other affiliates. Previous versions of its privacy policy warned users it could exchange information with its Chinese businesses, law enforcement agencies and public authorities, if legally required to do so.Banning WeChat in the U.S. could have far greater implications to cross-border business between Chinese and American companies, impacting everything from the manufacturing of medical face masks and Apple iPhones to the inking contracts of lawyers and bankers.While WeChat is not popular in the U.S. as a consumer messaging tool, the messaging app isn\u2019t just used to chat with friends and family.In China, it\u2019s virtually impossible to function without Wechat and is essentially used by businesses in the place of email and text messages, which are not used as widely in China as they are in the U.S. Other messaging apps like Facebook Inc.-owned Whatsapp are blocked in China, making it harder to communicate with overseas partners without WeChat.\u201cA ban on WeChat would be consequential because it would practically shut down communication between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Graham Webster, China Digital Economy Fellow at think tank New America. \u201cThere are real data, privacy, and security concerns but they go well beyond these two Chinese apps and these orders just wrap the real issues up in political theatre.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">",

The app is one of the most popular in the world with more than 1 billion users, and U.S. companies like Starbucks Corp., for example, use the service with consumers in China.Tencent is one of China\u2019s most valuable tech companies, and its Chief Executive Officer Pony Ma is among the many business leaders who serves as a delegate to the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament.Trump made his move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law that allows the president to declare a national emergency in response to an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat,\u201d allowing him to block transactions and seize assets.\u201cIEEPA is an incredibly expansive authority and allows the president to declare a national emergency with respect to just about anything,\u201d Brian Fleming, a lawyer at Miller & Chevalier in Washington who previously worked in the Justice Department\u2019s national security division. \u201cA legal challenge on the grounds that IEEPA does not provide the President authority to act with regard to something deemed to be a national security emergency would have a very low likelihood of success.\u201dIn his TikTok order, Trump said the app \u201cautomatically captures vast swaths\u201d of user data, including location information and browsing history.\u201cThis data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information -- potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage,\u201d Trump said.TikTok says American user data is stored in servers in the U.S. and Singapore, not China. But TikTok\u2019s terms of service stipulate that the company may share information with its parent, subsidiary or other affiliates. Previous versions of its privacy policy warned users it could exchange information with its Chinese businesses, law enforcement agencies and public authorities, if legally required to do so.Banning WeChat in the U.S. could have far greater implications to cross-border business between Chinese and American companies, impacting everything from the manufacturing of medical face masks and Apple iPhones to the inking contracts of lawyers and bankers.While WeChat is not popular in the U.S. as a consumer messaging tool, the messaging app isn\u2019t just used to chat with friends and family.In China, it\u2019s virtually impossible to function without Wechat and is essentially used by businesses in the place of email and text messages, which are not used as widely in China as they are in the U.S. Other messaging apps like Facebook Inc.-owned Whatsapp are blocked in China, making it harder to communicate with overseas partners without WeChat.\u201cA ban on WeChat would be consequential because it would practically shut down communication between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Graham Webster, China Digital Economy Fellow at think tank New America. \u201cThere are real data, privacy, and security concerns but they go well beyond these two Chinese apps and these orders just wrap the real issues up in political theatre.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">",

The decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit buys pipeline operator Energy Transfer LP some time after the July 6 shutdown order rocked the industry.\u201cDespite the mixed decision from the circuit court, the impact is wholly positive for the pipeline,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Brandon Barnes. Still, the decision leaves open the possibility that Dakota Access has to shut before an appeal is decided, he said.Although Energy Transfer units rose on the initial decision Wednesday, they tumbled 7.6% on Thursday in response to the company\u2019s reduction in adjusted earnings guidance for the year. General Counsel Tom Mason said during a conference call that the company was reviewing the court decision and will \u201crun the course\u201d with its Dakota Access litigation.\u201cWe believe our legal positions are strong, and we are confident that the pipeline will continue to operate,\u201d Mason said.The Army Corps is likely to allow the pipeline to continue operating, according to James W. Coleman, a professor at Southern Methodist University\u2019s Dedman School of Law. The question is then whether the Corps\u2019 decision holds up to scrutiny from the district court.\u201cThe bad news for the pipeline is that, if the district court orders a shutdown after considering the injunction standard, the same panel of three judges will hear a new request for a stay,\u201d Coleman said. So far, they seem inclined to agree with the district court on the need for more environmental review, he said.The oil industry has been watching the Dakota Access case with bated breath. Pipeline operators and developers are increasingly losing legal battles over key permits, but the Dakota Access order marked the first time a federal court told a major crude pipeline to shut due to violations of the National Environmental Policy Act.Dakota Access has been in service for three years after drawing months of on-the-ground protests during its construction near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The district court\u2019s July decision said the Army Corps of Engineers violated NEPA when it approved a key permit for the pipeline, ordering the project to shut down while the agency conducts a more robust review.Energy Transfer, led by billionaire Kelcy Warren, said the judge didn\u2019t have the authority to shut the pipeline and that the company would continue to accept capacity reservations beyond when the conduit was supposed to be drained. A week later, the D.C.

The decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit buys pipeline operator Energy Transfer LP some time after the July 6 shutdown order rocked the industry.\u201cDespite the mixed decision from the circuit court, the impact is wholly positive for the pipeline,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Brandon Barnes. Still, the decision leaves open the possibility that Dakota Access has to shut before an appeal is decided, he said.Although Energy Transfer units rose on the initial decision Wednesday, they tumbled 7.6% on Thursday in response to the company\u2019s reduction in adjusted earnings guidance for the year. General Counsel Tom Mason said during a conference call that the company was reviewing the court decision and will \u201crun the course\u201d with its Dakota Access litigation.\u201cWe believe our legal positions are strong, and we are confident that the pipeline will continue to operate,\u201d Mason said.The Army Corps is likely to allow the pipeline to continue operating, according to James W. Coleman, a professor at Southern Methodist University\u2019s Dedman School of Law. The question is then whether the Corps\u2019 decision holds up to scrutiny from the district court.\u201cThe bad news for the pipeline is that, if the district court orders a shutdown after considering the injunction standard, the same panel of three judges will hear a new request for a stay,\u201d Coleman said. So far, they seem inclined to agree with the district court on the need for more environmental review, he said.The oil industry has been watching the Dakota Access case with bated breath. Pipeline operators and developers are increasingly losing legal battles over key permits, but the Dakota Access order marked the first time a federal court told a major crude pipeline to shut due to violations of the National Environmental Policy Act.Dakota Access has been in service for three years after drawing months of on-the-ground protests during its construction near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The district court\u2019s July decision said the Army Corps of Engineers violated NEPA when it approved a key permit for the pipeline, ordering the project to shut down while the agency conducts a more robust review.Energy Transfer, led by billionaire Kelcy Warren, said the judge didn\u2019t have the authority to shut the pipeline and that the company would continue to accept capacity reservations beyond when the conduit was supposed to be drained. A week later, the D.C. Circuit issued a temporary stay of that order, allowing the line to keep operating.The company had also sought a more permanent stay, which the appeals court declined to grant on Wednesday.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting what the court did here,\u201d said Earthjustice lawyer Jan Hasselman, who represents the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against Dakota Access. \u201cWhile the focus has been on this judicially imposed shutdown order, the bigger picture is the environmental impact statement and whether a permit will be reissued under the next administration.\u201d(Updates with Energy Transfer units in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">",

While aggregated revenues are down nearly 10% year-over-year, many companies have been clearing the lowered expectations bar. Writing from Wells Fargo on the current mood and prospects, equity strategist Chris Harvey describes the situation as a \u2018melt up.\u2019 He sees room for another 5% growth in the S&P 500 by year\u2019s end.Harvey specifically noted that two policies put in place to support the economy against the corona virus shutdowns have had a boosting effect on the stock markets as well. The severe cutback in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and a spree of corporate bond buying both increased the relative value of stocks.The result has been a buying spree. Investors have pushed the S&P 500 to within its February pre-crash levels, and the NASDAQ has been setting new records since the end of June. Harvey\u2019s advice for investors? \u201cEnjoy the ride while it lasts,\u201d but expect \u201cless-stable markets\u201d at the end of the year.In the meantime, Harvey\u2019s colleagues at Wells Fargo have pointed out several stocks that are not just poised to make gains, but are also showing dividend yields in excess of 4%. It\u2019s an unbeatable combination for income-minded investors: share appreciation and high-yielding dividend returns.We\u2019ve pulled three of Wells Fargo&#39;s stock recommendations from the\u00a0TipRanks database, to find out what else makes them compelling buys.First Horizon (FHN)The first stock on our list today is a bank holding company. First Horizon is the owner of First Tennessee Bank, which has 180 consumer banking locations in Tennessee and the Southeast. Through its subsidiary, First Horizon provides retail and consumer banking, loans, and financial planning services. The company saw $1.9 billion in revenues last year.Like most of the banking sector, First Horizon saw revenues and earnings plummet in the first quarter of 2020. The shutdowns kept customers at home, and branch traffic dropped to near zero. EPS for the quarter came to just 5 cents, well below the 22-cent forecast and the 47-cent result from Q4. The partial reopenings led to a bounce in Q2, and EPS rose to 20 cents. Despite the tough conditions in 1H20, First Horizon has been able to acquire 30 branches of SunTrust\u2019s Truist bank, adding $2.3 billion to its assets on deposit and $440 million to loans under management. FHN has also kept its dividend payment stable, paying out 15 cents per common share in both Q1 and Q2, and recently declaring the Q3 payment at the same rate. The dividend yields is 6.4%, and the company has a 9-year history of keeping it reliable.Wells Fargo analyst Jared Shaw was particularly impressed by the merger, writing, \u201cWe view the successful completion of the merger as of 7/1 and reiteration of synergy targets related to it as a positive catalyst and that FHN should begin to reap the benefits almost immediately.\u201d Shaw added, \u201cWe continue to like the story at FHN and 6.5% dividend yield.\u201dIn line with his comments, Shaw rates FHN a Buy, and his $11 price target implies a one-year upside of 18% for the stock. (To watch Shaw\u2019s track record, click here)Similarly, the rest of the Street is getting onboard. The shares have a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 6 Buys and 1 Hold, while the $11.50 average price target suggests that FHN has room for 23% upside growth this year. (See First Horizon stock analysis on TipRanks)FirstEnergy (FE)FirstEnergy, the second stock on today\u2019s list, is another holding company \u2013 this time, in the utility industry in the state of Ohio. The company owns generation and distribution subsidiaries in the Ohio electric grid, as well as having an interest in the exploration, drilling, and transport of natural gas. FirstEnergy showed strong Q1 results, despite the coronavirus, and beat expectation on both EPS and revenues. Q2\u2019s results were lower sequentially, but still higher than expected. That was enough to support the $0.39 quarterly dividend payment. At $4.68 annually, this dividend gives a solid yield of 5.26%. Trouble has come for the company in the current quarter. Last month, several Ohio legislators were arrested by the FBI in a bribery scandal involving the bailout of a former FirstEnergy subsidiary. While FE was not directly involved in the scandal, it was close to all the players \u2013 and share fell sharply when news of the arrests broke. FE is down 32% from pre-scandal levels.Fortunately, the scandal is likely to fade without implicating FirstEnergy. The company spun off the affected subsidiary earlier this year, and has already announced that it will cooperate with the law enforcement investigation. FirstEnergy has over $3.5 billion in liquid assets on its balance sheet, a comfort for investors considering the possibilities of fines or legal costs.Covering FE for Wells Fargo, 4-star analyst Neil Kalton writes, \u201c[We] continue to believe that the current share price reflects a far worse potential financial outcome to the investigation... At this point, we view the potential risks to FE to be a federal fine and reputational issues\u2026 The FBI investigation has, to date, not resulted in the arrest of any FE employees..\u201dKalton sees the drop in FE\u2019s share price as an opportunity, reducing the cost of entry to an otherwise sound stock. He rates FE a Buy, and his $40 price target indicates confidence in a 40% one-year upside. (To watch Kalton\u2019s track record, click here)Overall, the Wall Street analyst consensus on FirstEnergy is a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys and 8 Holds issued in recent weeks. FE shares are trading for $29, and have an average price target of $38.32; this suggests a 12-month upside potential of 32%. (See FirstEnergy stock analysis on TipRanks)Baker Hughes Company (BKR)The last stock on our list is a support services company in the oil industry. Baker Hughes provides the specialized tech and engineering services \u2013 knowledge, tools, and roughnecks on the ground \u2013 that allow exploration companies to site and complete wells and maintain drilling operations. Baker Hughes offers services to upstream, midstream, and downstream companies in the oil industry.A combination of factors has pummeled BKR stock in 1H20. Demand for oil fell dramatically in the first quarter, as the lockdowns and economic halt reduced fuel consumption of all sorts. While economies are starting up, and oil demand is increasing, stockpiles are bloated and so prices are low. The result, for BKR, was deep sequential drops in Q1 and Q2 earnings. Q3 earnings are expected to turn positive, but at only 20% of pre-crisis levels.Still, investors can take heart on some fronts. Baker Hughes has maintained its dividend, holding the payment steady at 18 cents per share for common stock. The company has been paying out the dividend at this level for the last three years, and with the fall in share prices, the yield is now 4.3%.Christopher Voie, in his note on BKR for Wells Fargo, sees a clear path for the company next year. He writes, \u201cWe believe that BKR offers one of the more compelling product portfolios in OFS as well as unique growth opportunities from a diverse, technology driven oil service and industrial equipment platform.\u201d In particular, Voie likes the prospects for improved cash flow: \u201cWe expect significantly higher FCF in \u201921 (+$920 MM) due to higher margins across product lines and the absence of more than $700 MM of separation & restructuring cash costs.\u201dWith such an upbeat outlook, it\u2019s no wonder that Voie rates BKR shares a Buy. His $22 price target implies an upside of 31% for BKR shares in the year ahead. (To watch Voie\u2019s track record, click here)All in all, Wall Street is bullish on Baker Hughes. The stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 11 Buys against just 2 Holds. Shares are priced at $16.76, and the average price target, at $20.42, suggests it has a 21% upside potential.

COVID-19 continues to have a choke hold on the economy, yet stocks have pulled off an incredible recovery, with the S&P 500 up 50% since its March low point. But can the index keep the rally alive?Credit Suisse\u2019s global equity strategy analyst Andrew Garthwaite says yes, noting that by the end of next year, the S&P 500 could \u201ceasily hit 3,500 on our models.\u201d He believes there won\u2019t be a major correction, and that \u201cthe key is whether you want to buy into dips or sell into rallies and we want to buy into dips.\u201dWhy should investors keep buying? \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a combination of easy money, easy fiscal, with yield curve control \u2014 i.e. fiscal QE [quantitative easing] \u2014 until unemployment returns to politically acceptable levels,\u201d Garthwaite explained.Against this backdrop, Wall Street pros argue that certain sectors are holding up substantially better than the rest, and within these areas, compelling plays can be found. Highlighting the healthcare space, the pros say there are names that have not only received a lot of love from the analyst community, but also stand to deliver hefty returns through 2020 and beyond.As these stocks tend to be riskier in nature, we narrowed our search to include only the best of the best, according to the analyst community. TipRanks\u2019 database revealed three such stocks that won\u2019t break the bank.; each one trades for less than $5 per share and has earned a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating from the Street\u2019s pros. If that wasn\u2019t enough, plenty of upside potential is at play here.  Gritstone Oncology Inc. (GRTS)With the goal of stomping out cancer once and for all, Gritstone Oncology develops personalized immunotherapies to fight multiple cancer types. Currently going for $3.45 apiece, several members of the Street believe that the share price reflects an attractive entry point.Looking at the company\u2019s clinical activity, GRTS is conducting a Phase 1 dose escalation of its GRANITE (personalized vacccine targeting cancer neoantigens) and SLATE (off-the-shelf cancer vaccine targeting shared \u201chotspot\u201d neoantigens) in patients with advanced cancer. Updated data from July indicated that some patients had experienced prolonged stable disease and/or tumor regression, but none had risen to the level of a RECIST response.Weighing in on the results for H.C. Wainwright, analyst Sean Lee wrote, \u201cIn our view, GRANITE and SLATE are both safe and showed encouraging signs of efficacy, which should warrant further study in larger patient populations. Both GRANITE and SLATE are well-tolerated, and as of the June 30 data cut-off date, zero dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been reported in the GRANITE study and only two DLTs had been reported in the SLATE study... Therefore, we believe the 50% decline in GRTS stock price on July 13 to be an overreaction which has created an attractive buying opportunity.\u201dGoing forward, GRTS will kick off single-arm Phase 2 studies for both GRANITE and SLATE in advanced cancer in 2H20. For GRANITE, the study will include two cohorts of MSS-CRC patients with prior FOLFOX/FOLFIRI therapy and GEA patients with prior chemotherapy. Based on the fact that checkpoint inhibitors have either no (MSS-CRC) or very little (GEA) activity in GI tumors, management has stated that if multiple responses in these cohorts are observed, it would demonstrate additive efficacy and could ultimately support accelerated approval.As for SLATE, GRTS is set to evaluate the original cassette of SLATE (Cassette v1) in ovarian cancer patients with the TP53 mutation and NSCLC patients with prior immunotherapy/chemotherapy. A new version of the SLATE cassette (Cassette v2) designed to optimize the immune response to KRAS mutations will also be assed.\u201cThe Phase 2 GRANITE study is expected to report data in 2H21, and the results from Phase 2 studies of SLATE Cassette v1 and Cassette v2 are anticipated in 1H21 and 2H21, respectively. In our view, all of these could be major catalysts for the stock,\u201d Lee commented.To this end, LEE rates GRTS a Buy along with a $16 price target. Should his thesis play out, a potential twelve-month gain of 365% could be in the cards. (To watch Lee\u2019s track record, click here) Other analysts are also optimistic about the stock. GRTS&#39; Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells. In addition, the $14 average price target brings the upside potential to 307%. (See GRTS stock analysis on TipRanks)PDS Biotechnology Corporation (PDSB)Using its patented Versamune platform, PDS Biotechnology develops innovative infectious disease (ID) vaccines and cancer immunotherapies. Based on its impressive technology platform and $4.35 share price, it\u2019s no wonder this name is scoring the Street\u2019s attention.5-star analyst Geulah Livshits, of Chardan Capital, is even more optimistic after a recent call with PDSB\u2019s CMO Dr. Lauren Wood.Highlighting the takeaways from the call, Livshits points out that it\u2019s important to consider the similarities between cancer and ID pathogens. Part of the problem when it comes to developing cancer-targeting vaccines is that many cancer antigens are also present in normal tissue, with the immune system failing to view these self-antigens as foreign. \u201cAs such, a key gating factor for developing cancer vaccines, which can translate over to ID vaccine development, is triggering innate immunity (specifically type I interferon signals),\u201d the analyst explained.According to Dr. Wood, T cell responses are often longer-lived than antibody responses. Livshits wrote, \u201cAlthough the field does not yet fully understand what that means for immunity duration (or indeed what titer levels are sufficient for protection from SARS-CoV-2), the efficient induction of a high quality T cell response may promote longer lasting immune memory, potentially translating to longer protection or a milder disease course upon subsequent exposure.\u201dThat\u2019s where PDSB comes in. Versamune is an adjuvant designed to overcome the mechanisms that suppress the innate immune response, specifically triggering type I interferons. In both cancer and ID, Versamune triggers \u201cexcellent presentation of antigens\u201d by both the class I and class II pathways, creating potent, broad and long-lived T cell responses, as well as antibody responses.Also encouraging, the platform can stimulate the immune system locally (in the skin) when delivered, with Dr. Wood also noting that \u201cVersamune&#39;s adjuvant tech can be co-formulated and delivered with other platforms beyond protein/peptides, including DNA or mRNA, to enhance immunogenicity.\u201dLooking at its performance in a clinical setting, there has been a documented triggering of type I interferons associated with HPV tumor regression in a clinical mouse model, verified immune memory demonstrated by mice resistant to tumor re-challenge, high levels of specific CD8 killer T cells within two weeks of a single dose of vaccine and T cell regression of virus-mediated lesions. Versamune has also been well tolerated.Adding to the good news, in preclinical studies, when Versamune was co-delivered with Fluzone, a seasonal influenza vaccine, neutralizing antibody titers were 40x higher compared to Fluzone alone. Livshits added, \u201cWith regard to SARS-CoV-2, initial preclinical data in mice show the Versamune-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate induces robust neutralizing antibody response levels equivalent to those observed in recovering Covid-19 patients within 2 weeks of vaccination.\u201dIt\u2019s clear why Livshits continues to take a bullish stance. In addition to keeping a Buy recommendation on the stock, the price target remains at $10. The implication for investors? Upside potential of 150%. (To watch Livshits\u2019 track record, click here)    With 3 &quot;buy&quot; ratings against just 1 &quot;hold,&quot; PDSB shares have earned their Strong Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, the $7.32 average price target implies shares could climb 83% higher in the next twelve months. (See PDSB stock analysis on TipRanks)GlycoMimetics (GLYC)Hoping to improve the lives of patients with unmet medical needs, GlycoMimetics develops small-molecule glycomimetic product candidates. According to Wall Street analysts, at $3.86, its share price could present investors with an opportunity to get in on the action.Standing squarely with the bulls is Roth Capital\u2019s Zegbeh Jallah. Following the analyst\u2019s virtual meeting with the management team, he is confident in GLYC\u2019s long-term growth prospects.Pointing to GLYC\u2019s Phase 3 Rivipansel asset, which was designed as a treatment for patients with Sickle Cell, Jallah argues that there is a substantial market opportunity. In the U.S., there are roughly 100,000 sickle cell patients, with some of these hospitalized 1-3 times per year for painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOCs). Opioids are the current standard of care, but there are significant concerns regarding dependency. \u201cWe believe that a need exists for treatment options that can lessen the risks associated with opioid use, without leaving patients in pain,\u201d the analyst commented.Currently, Rivipansel, an IV-delivered, pan-selectin antagonist, is the only therapy being clinically developed for this application. It differs from Novartis\u2019 Crizanlizumab, a p-selectin antibody that is used to prevent VOCs, as p-selectin plays an earlier role than other selectins. \u201cWith Rivipansel more potent against e-selectin and with a half-life of 8 hours, Phase 1 data showed that its benefits were present after the onset of a VOC,\u201d Jallah explained.As for the Phase 2 study, the results were also encouraging. However, in the Phase 3 study, the drug failed to meet its primary endpoint of time to readiness-to-discharge. That being said, Jallah still has high hopes. Expounding on this, the analyst stated, \u201cEncouragingly, recent post-hoc analysis showed that patients treated early in their VOC achieved a significant benefit, and management noted that similar trends were observed in the Phase 2 study where there was also a significant reduction (83%) in IV opioid use. In line with the outcomes of the post-hoc analysis, an important difference between the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies was that patients were treated earlier in their VOC in Phase 2 than in Phase 3.\u201dNow that Rivipansel is wholly-owned by GLYC (the company had previously partnered with Pfizer on the program), management will discuss the next steps with the FDA as well as offer additional analysis of the Phase 3 study.When it comes to Phase 3 Uproleselan, which has received Breakthrough Designation, Jallah believes it \u201ccould be an excellent backbone therapy to multiple agents and in multiple treatment settings of AML, with its balanced efficacy and safety profile.\u201d He added, \u201c...novel drugs that can allow patients to become eligible for curative transplants would be a major value-add. GlycoMimetics\u2019 Uproleselan has the potential to do just that, as it can impair signaling that leads to resistance, allowing for multiple treatment combinations to result in deeper remissions and long-term effectiveness.\u201d Its GMI-1359 candidate, which is currently in Phase 1, \u201ccould have potential in multiple tumor types including leukemias and solid tumors.\u201dWith upcoming catalysts from these clinical programs and a cash runway of two years, the deal is sealed for Jallah. To this end, he maintained a Buy recommendation and $9 price target, suggesting 133% upside potential. (To watch Jallah\u2019s track record, click here)  Looking at the consensus breakdown, other analysts have also been impressed. Based on 4 Buys and no Holds or Sells, the word on the Street is that GLYC is a Strong Buy. Not to mention the $11 average price target is more aggressive than Jallah\u2019s and implies 187% upside potential.

COVID-19 continues to have a choke hold on the economy, yet stocks have pulled off an incredible recovery, with the S&P 500 up 50% since its March low point. But can the index keep the rally alive?Credit Suisse\u2019s global equity strategy analyst Andrew Garthwaite says yes, noting that by the end of next year, the S&P 500 could \u201ceasily hit 3,500 on our models.\u201d He believes there won\u2019t be a major correction, and that \u201cthe key is whether you want to buy into dips or sell into rallies and we want to buy into dips.\u201dWhy should investors keep buying? \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a combination of easy money, easy fiscal, with yield curve control \u2014 i.e. fiscal QE [quantitative easing] \u2014 until unemployment returns to politically acceptable levels,\u201d Garthwaite explained.Against this backdrop, Wall Street pros argue that certain sectors are holding up substantially better than the rest, and within these areas, compelling plays can be found. Highlighting the healthcare space, the pros say there are names that have not only received a lot of love from the analyst community, but also stand to deliver hefty returns through 2020 and beyond.As these stocks tend to be riskier in nature, we narrowed our search to include only the best of the best, according to the analyst community. TipRanks\u2019 database revealed three such stocks that won\u2019t break the bank.; each one trades for less than $5 per share and has earned a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating from the Street\u2019s pros. If that wasn\u2019t enough, plenty of upside potential is at play here.  Gritstone Oncology Inc. (GRTS)With the goal of stomping out cancer once and for all, Gritstone Oncology develops personalized immunotherapies to fight multiple cancer types. Currently going for $3.45 apiece, several members of the Street believe that the share price reflects an attractive entry point.Looking at the company\u2019s clinical activity, GRTS is conducting a Phase 1 dose escalation of its GRANITE (personalized vacccine targeting cancer neoantigens) and SLATE (off-the-shelf cancer vaccine targeting shared \u201chotspot\u201d neoantigens) in patients with advanced cancer. Updated data from July indicated that some patients had experienced prolonged stable disease and/or tumor regression, but none had risen to the level of a RECIST response.Weighing in on the results for H.C. Wainwright, analyst Sean Lee wrote, \u201cIn our view, GRANITE and SLATE are both safe and showed encouraging signs of efficacy, which should warrant further study in larger patient populations. Both GRANITE and SLATE are well-tolerated, and as of the June 30 data cut-off date, zero dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been reported in the GRANITE study and only two DLTs had been reported in the SLATE study...

As earnings results continue to roll in, investors will be watching for any update on the next economic stimulus package along with the non-farm payroll report slated for release this Friday. Against this backdrop, plenty of questions remain, weighing on the minds of both institutional and private investors.In a recent note to clients, Oppenheimer\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist John Stoltzfus addresses these concerns. When it comes to stocks\u2019 disconnected state, he writes that the market tends to focus on the future, with it betting on a successful outcome based on the stimulus policy already put in place. But will this highly accommodative monetary policy eventually cause inflation?\u201cWe do not expect high levels of inflation to result from the extraordinary stimulus and monetary policy taken to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. Federal Reserve vigilance against inflation (as well as vigilance by central banks around the world) is likely to be able to suitably address any flare up of inflation,\u201d Stoltzfus commented.Bearing this in mind, we took a closer look at three stocks backed by the analysts at Oppenheimer, the third best-performing research firm, according to TipRanks. Running the tickers through TipRanks\u2019 database, we learned Oppenheimer sees at least 120% upside potential in store for each, and all three have earned a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating from the rest of the Street.Durect Corporation (DRRX)Developing innovative therapies based on its endogenous epigenetic regulator program, Durect believes it could potentially transform the treatment of acute organ injury and chronic liver diseases. As one of its candidates has delivered encouraging results, Oppenheimer sees an opportunity to get in on the action.Firm analyst Francois Brisebois recently told clients, \u201cAfter several years of promising results, we believe DRRX&#39;s endogenous small molecule epigenetic regulator DUR-928 has finally found its home in the treatment of Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH). Given a high level of mortality (26% 1-month rate) and no viable treatment options, we believe DUR-928&#39;s fairly early robust Phase 2a efficacy and safety data could have it attacking this ~ $3 billion market opportunity with peak penetration as early as 2025.\u201dDigging a bit deeper into this Phase 2a data, along with a robust safety profile, the trial showed that the therapy was able to rapidly reduce bilirubin, a marker of AH. In addition, there was a 100% response to treatment from the Lille score (mortality predictor tool) in 30mg and 90mg dosages and reduction in MELD (AH severity). Going forward, AH Phase 2b is set to begin in 2H20.   \u201cGiven the potential to receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for treating a life-threatening condition with a substantial improvement over available therapies (mainly corticosteroids), launch could happen ahead of anticipation. Additionally, market exclusivity and pricing could be greater if Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) is awarded based on ~117,000 annual hospitalizations,\u201d Brisebois added.Plenty of other catalysts are still ahead, in Brisebois\u2019 opinion. DUR-928 is being evaluated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with acute liver or kidney injury in a Phase 2 study and Phase 1b NASH data could be released during an upcoming conference. It should also be noted that it\u2019s a \u201cwaiting game\u201d for Posimir\u2019s PDUFA, with the analyst considering \u201cany related weakness as a buying opportunity.\u201dAll of the above makes Brisebois optimistic about DRRX\u2019s long-term growth prospects. As a result, the analyst continues to assign an Outperform rating and $7 price target to the stock. Should his thesis play out, a potential twelve-month gain of 202% could be in the cards. (To watch Brisebois\u2019 track record, click here) Brisebois\u2019 colleagues are also pounding the table on DRRX. Only Buy ratings, 4, in fact, have been issued in the last three months, so the consensus rating is a Strong Buy. At $6, the average price target implies shares could climb 156% higher in the next year. (See DRRX stock analysis on TipRanks)Avadel Pharmaceuticals (AVDL)Hoping to address overlooked and unmet medical needs, Avadel Pharmaceuticals wants to provide solutions through its patient-focused and cutting-edge products. With Oppenheimer stating its asset has \u201cdisruptive potential in a proven blockbuster market,\u201d the firm believes it might be time to snap up shares.  According to analyst Francois Brisebois, who also covers DRRX, AVDL is primarily focused on FT218, a once-nightly sodium oxybate designed for the treatment of narcolepsy patients suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. He goes so far as to call the candidate the company\u2019s \u201cfirst, second and third priorities,\u201d noting that it recently sold its Hospital Drug Portfolio \u201cto avoid distractions.\u201dLooking at the pivotal Phase 3 REST-ON top-line data, Brisebois believes it \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d At the 9g dose, FT218 was able to produce a change from baseline in Maintenance of Wakefulness (MWT) of 10.82 minutes vs. 4.469 in placebo, in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) of 72% vs. 31.6% and in Mean Weekly Cataplexy Attacks of -11.51 vs. -4.86, all three of the co-primary endpoints. \u201cWe were particularly impressed that the 6g and 7.5g doses also showed p&lt;0.001 across all co-primary endpoints,\u201d the analyst added.The implication? \u201cFollowing strong efficacy and safety data, we believe FT218 could significantly disrupt Jazz Pharmaceuticals&#39; Xyrem (twice-nightly sodium oxybate), which reported FY19 sales of $1.6 billion,\u201d Brisebois said.While some investors have expressed concern regarding the company\u2019s freedom to operate, Brisebois isn\u2019t too worried. \u201cWe are comfortable with AVDL&#39;s freedom to operate path forward as we don&#39;t believe it will infringe on Xyrem&#39;s IP (REMS or DDI). Although FT218 does use the same drug substance, it consists of a substantially different drug product. The label should add more clarity,\u201d he explained.Additionally, management has made a significant effort to drive a turnaround. Brisebois points out that since CEO Greg Divis was appointed in June 2019, he has offered clear guidance on enrollment, which has led to huge gains in the share price. He also mentioned, \u201cDr. Jordan Dubow&#39;s appointment as CMO was key because of his important role in adjusting the original study design (data a year ahead of expectations). New CFO Thomas McHugh&#39;s commercial experience is crucial.\u201dGiven everything that AVDL has going for it, it\u2019s clear why Brisebois joined the bulls. In addition to initiating coverage with an Outperform rating, the analyst put a $19 price target on the stock. What does this mean for investors? Upside potential of 134% is at play.Overall, the bulls take the lead on this one. Out of 5 total reviews published in the last three months, all 5 analysts rated the stock a Buy. Therefore, the message is clear: AVDL is a Strong Buy. The $18.40 average price target implies shares could skyrocket 126% in the next twelve months. (See Avadel stock analysis on TipRanks)CymaBay Therapeutics (CBAY)Last but not least we have CymaBay Therapeutics, which develops therapies designed to improve the lives of patients with liver and other chronic diseases. Given its impressive technology, Oppenheimer has high hopes.Covering the stock for the firm, analyst Jay Olson points out that its seladelpar asset produced strong results in the ENHANCE Phase 3 study in PBC. As it was terminated early and there were only a small number of patients that reached 12 months, the primary endpoint was changed to 3 months. The revised primary composite and key secondary ALP normalization endpoints were both statistically significant at 10mg. \u201cWe believe these impressive efficacy results could set a new paradigm for physicians and patients as they strive to achieve ALP normalization,\u201d the analyst commented.Going into more detail, 30% of patients in the study had moderate-to-severe pruritus, and the pruritus levels were balanced and representative of high-risk PBC patients, in Olson\u2019s opinion. Unlike Ocaliva, which has a warning for severe pruritus with management strategies that include temporary dosing interruption, seladelpar was able to generate a substantial improvement in pruritus.Based on this promising data, CBAY could kick off a Phase 3 PBC study. \u201cWe expect CBAY to initiate this simplified Phase 3 PBC trial in 1Q21 with 12-month primary endpoint for pivotal data in 2023. The safety profile of seladelpar is similar to placebo and compares favorably to Ocaliva&#39;s which has a boxed warning for dosing in certain patients,\u201d Olson stated.When it comes to the NASH indication, Phase 2b 52-week biopsy data, which showed a solid reduction in fibrosis and NASH resolution, could support seladelpar\u2019s progression to Phase 3. It should be noted that CBAY might seek a partner here.With the company boasting a path forward in 2L PBC that could establish seladelpar as the standard of care, the deal is sealed for Olson. To this end, the analyst rates CBAY an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $12 price target. This figure suggests 127.5% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Olson\u2019s track record, click here)  Looking at the consensus breakdown, other analysts echo Olson\u2019s sentiment. With 8 Buys compared to no Holds or Sells, the word on the Street is that CBAY is a Strong Buy. In addition, the $12 average price target is identical to the Oppenheimer analyst\u2019s.

The firm launched buffers in 2018, targeting retail investors and financial advisers looking to manage risk.\u201cThey\u2019re just completely exposed to the tragedy and the upside of the market,\u201d said Bond, Innovator\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cThe more sophisticated investors, they control that exposure.\u201dThe good news for investors piling in is that so far this year, buffer funds have performed as promised.At the height of March volatility, the $246 million Innovator S&P 500 Power Buffer ETF, ticker POCT, was down 17.5% for the year compared with a 30% slump for the S&P 500. Five months later, the U.S. benchmark is up about 4% and the ETF has gained around 2.8%.While Innovator currently commands the lion\u2019s share of defined-outcome ETF assets, popularity and performance are breeding competition. Allianz Investment Management launched two buffers in June to complement its similarly structured variable annuity lineup, while New York Life Investments\u2019 IndexIQ unit has also filed plans.Meanwhile, the largest buffer fund on the market is the FT Cboe Vest U.S. Equity Deep Buffer ETF - February, which has gathered $510 million in assets since launching six months ago. The debut was well-timed, according to Cboe Vest\u2019s Karan Sood -- the virus-fueled turmoil in the weeks which followed showed a traditional portfolio mix of 60% equities and 40% fixed-income failed to effectively shield portfolios.\u201cIn March of this year, everything went down together,\u201d said Sood, Cboe Vest CEO and a portfolio manager of the fund. \u201cThis style is not dependent on historical relationships holding up in the future, it\u2019s forward-looking.\u201dDefined-outcome ETFs may soon branch outside of equities. Innovator filed plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June for the Innovator 20+ Year Treasury Bond 5% Floor ETF \u2013 July, which would track the performance of BlackRock Inc.\u2019s iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF on a buffered basis.Such a strategy would protect investors from the growing duration risk -- a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes -- as long-dated Treasury yields fall, Bond said.\u201cIf you want to stay invested in fixed-income today you either need to get in a money-market fund or go super short-term,\u201d he said. \u201cThis allows you to stay in long Treasuries in a 60-40 type portfolio mix, but cuts off the risk tail.\u201d(Updates prices in 6th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">",

The company also announced Chief Financial Officer Ajay Vashee is stepping down effective Sept. 15, sending the shares tumbling in extended trading.The San Francisco-based file-sharing company said sales rose 16% in the second quarter to $467.4 million. Dropbox reported its second consecutive quarter of profits, with net income of $17.5 million, or 4 cents a share, in the three months ending June 30, compared with a loss of $21.4 million, or 5 cents a share, in the year earlier period.Analysts\u2019 had forecast revenue of $465 million and a loss per share of 2 cents.For years Dropbox has been working to cut costs and add paying customers for its software, which helps people sync and share files through the internet. Demand for such services has gotten a boost as coronavirus-related lockdowns forced employees to work remotely, creating a greater need to collaborate and pass files between office and home computers.Dropbox now has 15 million paying users, up from 13.6 million in the same period last year. Revenue per average user was $126.88, an increase from $120.48 a year earlier.Vashee, who has been with the company for more than eight years, will be succeeded by Tim Regan, Dropbox\u2019s chief accounting officer. Dropbox fell about 7% in extended trading after closing at $23.27 in New York. The stock has gained 30% this year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.<p><br clear=\"all\">",

    "title": "3 Big Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 8%; Raymond James Says \u2018Buy\u2019",
    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-big-dividend-stocks-yielding-163557603.html\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Lch2o9II2ZUWx3i66aViqw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/198ccb855dbbb8fc6ab840c08d1ded1c\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"3 Big Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 8%; Raymond James Says \u2018Buy\u2019\" align=\"left\" title=\"3 Big Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 8%; Raymond James Says \u2018Buy\u2019\" border=\"0\" ></a>Investment firm Raymond James has released its July performance recap, summing up the fourth month of the economic recovery. The firm notes that the early weeks of this recovery cycle showed a V-shaped turnaround for the economy, which has since slowed, taking a \u201ctreading water\u201d patter. Raymond James sees defensive stock plays in a strong position, as they have somewhat outperformed since the second week of June.Raymond James strategist Tavis McCourt sees the slowing pattern as predictable, and linked to the pace of Congressional action on recovery stimulus packages. McCourt writes, \u201cWith D.C. negotiating another package, it is likely that high frequency economic data will decelerate in early August before another round of stimulus is signed, but the market clearly believes the likelihood is that more direct support at similar scale is likely through the election.\u201dThis makes defensive stocks part of a consistent strategy, to keep returns coming in for reinvestment. With this in mind, we used TipRanks database to pull up the stats on three stocks that Raymond James analysts have tapped as buying propositions. These are stocks with a specific set of clear attributes, that frequently indicate a strong defensive profile: a high dividend yield -- over 8%; and a considerable upside potential.Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP)The first stock on our list is the midstream affiliate of Phillips 66. PSXP spun off the oil giant to operate the natural gas and crude oil pipelines, along with terminals and processing plants, that move product from the producer to the distributors. The company\u2019s network of transport assets extends from the central US to the Gulf coast of Texas and Louisiana.PSXP has shown a combination of poor share performance in the economic downturn plus relatively strong quarterly earnings. The stock is still down 53% from February\u2019s pre-crash levels, while EPS beat expectations in both Q1 and Q2. The second quarter results also showed a sharp upward turn sequentially from Q1, coming in at $1.05.The company has used its earnings to keep up the dividend payment. The quarterly payment has been stable at 87.5 cents per common share for the past three quarters, and at $3.50 annualized give a yield of 12.7%. This is more than 6x higher than the average dividend yield found on the S&P 500. PSXP has a 7-year history of dividend reliability.The dividend is only part of the positive picture here. Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins writes, \u201cDespite the near-term volatility in PSXP from pandemic/demand and regulatory risks, we remain positive on the long term outlook. Longer-term, PSXP benefits from a solid backstop from Phillips 66 (PSX) relative to peers. The interplay between the Phillips franchise provides growth optionality, especially as demand normalizes\u2026\u201dJenkins gives this stock a Buy rating, and his $36 price target suggests an upside of 30% for the coming year. (To watch Jenkins\u2019 track record, click here)Overall, Phillips 66 Partners has a Moderate Buy from Wall Street\u2019s analysts, based on 6 Buy and 3 Hold ratings given in recent weeks. The stock is currently trading for $28.15, and the average price target, at $37.11, is slightly more bullish than Jenkins\u2019, suggesting a 32% one-year upside to the shares. (See PSXP stock analysis on TipRanks)Black Stone Minerals LP (BSM)Next on our list, Black Stone Minerals, is another player in the hydrocarbon industry. Black Stone is an exploration and development company, with land use rights on 20 million acres in 40 states, with two main focuses: the South, with holdings from Texas across to Alabama, and the Northern Plains, where it operates in Montana and the Dakotas. Appalachian gas plays in West Virginia and Pennsylvania round out Black Stone\u2019s operations.Depressed demand and economic lockdown policies kept impacted profits, and Black Stone\u2019s earnings dropped sharply in Q2. The company has maintained its dividend payment, however, adjusting the payout to keep it in-line with debt reduction efforts and improved free cash flow during 1H20.The success of those efforts can be seen by the 88% increase in the dividend from Q1 to Q2, despite the fall in earnings. The current dividend is 15 cents per share, or 60 cents annualized, and gives a strong dividend yield of 8.2%. Covering the stock for Raymond James, analyst John Freeman gives BSM shares a Buy rating. His $9 price target suggests it has room for a 22.5% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Freeman\u2019s track record, click here)Supporting his stance, Freeman points out the company\u2019s improving balance sheet. He writes, \u201cAs a result of their announced asset sale, BSM&#39;s borrowing base was reduced to $430M (down 7%) in 2Q. The company had $153M drawn at the end of July putting their utilization at a little over 35% currently. BSM ended the quarter with leverage at a low 1x.\u201d &quot;We applaud the reduced leverage profile and increasing distribution (nearly doubled q/q), while continuing to like BSM&#39;s diverse asset base and steps towards Shelby Trough development,&quot; the analyst added. Overall, the analyst consensus rating on Black Stone, a Moderate Buy, is based on an even split \u2013 2 Buys and 2 Holds. The stock\u2019s $9.25 average price target suggests an upside of 26% from the $7.38 trading price. (See BSM stock analysis on TipRanks)Oneok, Inc. (OKE)Last on the list today is Oneok (pronounced One-Oak), another midstream company in the natural gas industry. Oneok operates in the Permian Basin, the Mid-Continent region, and the Rocky Mountain states, with a network of assets including pipelines, processing plants, and storage facilities.Oneok has underperformed in 1H20, despite a strong Q1 performance. The company\u2019s earnings fell from 83 cents per share in first quarter to 32 cents in the second. Shares fell sharply in early March, and have yet to recover value; OKE is down 54% from pre-crash levels, and is simply not gaining traction.At the same time, the company does have those valuable midstream assets, and has held its dividend stable at 93.5 cents per common share, giving a yield of 12.8%. Those strengths make the low share price an attractive point of entry, a factor noted by Raymond James.Writing for the firm, James Weston says, \u201cAt ONEOK (OKE), we still see a solid management team, generalist-friendly structure, and intense Bakken operating leverage in a more constructive environment (which may begin to show itself somewhat in 3Q financials). True, Bakken regulatory headwinds would drive tack-on impacts through the value-chain and could push leverage sustainably above ~5x in our model. However, the painful ~60% YTD sell-off took OKE from a peer premium to a slight peer discount, largely pricing in this risk. Further, OKE remains an attractive total return story as our base case avoids a cut to its ~13% dividend yield.&quot;To this end, Weston puts a $33 price target behind his Buy rating, implying a about 10% upside to the stock from current levels. (To watch Weston\u2019s track record, click here)Overall, with 2 Buy ratings, 13 Holds, and 1 Sell, the analyst consensus rating on OKE is a Hold. Meanwhile, the stock is selling for $29.73, and the average price target, $34.07, suggests it has ~15% upside for the year ahead.

The current dividend is 15 cents per share, or 60 cents annualized, and gives a strong dividend yield of 8.2%. Covering the stock for Raymond James, analyst John Freeman gives BSM shares a Buy rating. His $9 price target suggests it has room for a 22.5% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Freeman\u2019s track record, click here)Supporting his stance, Freeman points out the company\u2019s improving balance sheet. He writes, \u201cAs a result of their announced asset sale, BSM&#39;s borrowing base was reduced to $430M (down 7%) in 2Q. The company had $153M drawn at the end of July putting their utilization at a little over 35% currently. BSM ended the quarter with leverage at a low 1x.\u201d &quot;We applaud the reduced leverage profile and increasing distribution (nearly doubled q/q), while continuing to like BSM&#39;s diverse asset base and steps towards Shelby Trough development,&quot; the analyst added. Overall, the analyst consensus rating on Black Stone, a Moderate Buy, is based on an even split \u2013 2 Buys and 2 Holds. The stock\u2019s $9.25 average price target suggests an upside of 26% from the $7.38 trading price. (See BSM stock analysis on TipRanks)Oneok, Inc. (OKE)Last on the list today is Oneok (pronounced One-Oak), another midstream company in the natural gas industry. Oneok operates in the Permian Basin, the Mid-Continent region, and the Rocky Mountain states, with a network of assets including pipelines, processing plants, and storage facilities.Oneok has underperformed in 1H20, despite a strong Q1 performance. The company\u2019s earnings fell from 83 cents per share in first quarter to 32 cents in the second. Shares fell sharply in early March, and have yet to recover value; OKE is down 54% from pre-crash levels, and is simply not gaining traction.At the same time, the company does have those valuable midstream assets, and has held its dividend stable at 93.5 cents per common share, giving a yield of 12.8%. Those strengths make the low share price an attractive point of entry, a factor noted by Raymond James.Writing for the firm, James Weston says, \u201cAt ONEOK (OKE), we still see a solid management team, generalist-friendly structure, and intense Bakken operating leverage in a more constructive environment (which may begin to show itself somewhat in 3Q financials). True, Bakken regulatory headwinds would drive tack-on impacts through the value-chain and could push leverage sustainably above ~5x in our model. However, the painful ~60% YTD sell-off took OKE from a peer premium to a slight peer discount, largely pricing in this risk. Further, OKE remains an attractive total return story as our base case avoids a cut to its ~13% dividend yield.&quot;To this end, Weston puts a $33 price target behind his Buy rating, implying a about 10% upside to the stock from current levels. (To watch Weston\u2019s track record, click here)Overall, with 2 Buy ratings, 13 Holds, and 1 Sell, the analyst consensus rating on OKE is a Hold. Meanwhile, the stock is selling for $29.73, and the average price target, $34.07, suggests it has ~15% upside for the year ahead.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has sold about 1 million of his shares in the e-commerce company so far in August, according to multiple filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.What Happened: The shares sold by Bezos were worth more than $3 billion, priced between $3,102.85 and $3,183.26 a piece, at the time of sale.The SEC filings said the transactions were &quot;effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the reporting person.&quot;The world&#39;s richest person previously shed about $4.1 billion worth of Amazon shares between January and February this year.Why It Matters: Bezos&#39;s total sale of more than $7 billion worth of shares of the e-commerce giant so far this year is already significantly higher than last year&#39;s total sale of $2.8 billion, according to CNBC, which earlier reported the news.The billionaire has stated he intends to sell about $1 billion worth of shares each year to fund his space exploration company Blue Origin, which rivals Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX.Bezos has also engaged in philanthropy over the years, including launching &quot;Day One Fund,&quot; an initiative to help homeless families and increase education access through preschools.The Amazon CEO&#39;s former wife Mackenzie Scott announced late last month she had donated about $1.7 billion of the money she got as part of a divorce settlement to a host of charities.Price Action: Amazon shares closed 2.1% higher at $3,205.03 on Wednesday, and traded about 0.4% lower in the after-hours session.Photo courtesy: Steve Jurvetson on FlickrSee more from Benzinga  * Sycamore Partners Leads Bid To Acquire Bankrupt JCPenney At .75B, Proposes Merger With Belks: Report  * Amazon Agrees To Pay Treasury Department To Settle Allegations Of US Sanctions Violations  * Amazon Pulls All Washington Redskins Merchandise From Its Platform Over Name Controversy(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has sold about 1 million of his shares in the e-commerce company so far in August, according to multiple filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.What Happened: The shares sold by Bezos were worth more than $3 billion, priced between $3,102.85 and $3,183.26 a piece, at the time of sale.The SEC filings said the transactions were &quot;effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the reporting person.&quot;The world&#39;s richest person previously shed about $4.1 billion worth of Amazon shares between January and February this year.Why It Matters: Bezos&#39;s total sale of more than $7 billion worth of shares of the e-commerce giant so far this year is already significantly higher than last year&#39;s total sale of $2.8 billion, according to CNBC, which earlier reported the news.The billionaire has stated he intends to sell about $1 billion worth of shares each year to fund his space exploration company Blue Origin, which rivals Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX.Bezos has also engaged in philanthropy over the years, including launching &quot;Day One Fund,&quot; an initiative to help homeless families and increase education access through preschools.The Amazon CEO&#39;s former wife Mackenzie Scott announced late last month she had donated about $1.7 billion of the money she got as part of a divorce settlement to a host of charities.Price Action: Amazon shares closed 2.1% higher at $3,205.03 on Wednesday, and traded about 0.4% lower in the after-hours session.Photo courtesy: Steve Jurvetson on FlickrSee more from Benzinga  * Sycamore Partners Leads Bid To Acquire Bankrupt JCPenney At .75B, Proposes Merger With Belks: Report  * Amazon Agrees To Pay Treasury Department To Settle Allegations Of US Sanctions Violations  * Amazon Pulls All Washington Redskins Merchandise From Its Platform Over Name Controversy(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.
