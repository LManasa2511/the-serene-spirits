    "description": "<p>Shares of Acadia Healthcare Co. Inc.  fell nearly 6% in the extended session Tuesday after the company reported second-quarter revenue below Wall Street expectations and said it was expanding its offerings thanks to the mental-health toll it expects the pandemic will exact. Acadia said it earned $41.1 million, or 46 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with earnings of $48.1 million, or 55 cents a share, for the same period in 2019. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 54 cents a share. Revenue fell to $750.3 million from $789.4 million a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet expected adjusted earnings of 39 cents a share on revenue of $763 million. A decrease in per-day revenue is \"primarily attributable to a decline in outpatient volumes and reimbursement in certain markets for CTC in-person services that was temporarily affected by stay-at-home orders,\" Acadia said. Volumes improved toward the end of the quarter as more localities eased restrictions, the company said. \"We believe the ongoing mental and emotional toll caused by continuing economic and societal concerns will further increase the already strong demand for mental health and substance use treatments we provide in the U.S. and U.K.,\" Acadia said in a statement. \"We continue to make the necessary investments to serve our patients' needs through bed expansion opportunities and additional service offerings.\" Acadia ended the regular trading session up 0.3%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

    "description": "<p>Texas Roadhouse Inc.  shares closed up 4.1% on Tuesday after the casual dining chain reported a steady increase in comparable sales during the second-quarter late Monday, aided by its ability to serve more dine-in customers. Net losses totaled $33.6 million, or 48 cents per share, after net income of $44.8 million, or 63 cents per share, last year. Revenue of $476.4 million fell from $689.8 million last year. The FactSet consensus was for a loss of 62 cents per share and revenue of $477.0 million. Comparable sales were down 32.8% for the quarter, rising from April (down 46.7%) through June (down 14.1%). \"Those limited capacity restaurants for July were down 11.2% and we've got a pretty fair mix of 100% capacity restaurants, 75%, 50% down to 25%,\" said Tonya Robinson, chief financial officer for Texas Roadhouse on the call, according to a FactSet transcript. Whether the capacity is far reduced or at 100%, Robinson also said the company's to-go business \"holds pretty well across the board.\" The highest number of restaurants, 332, are operating at 50% capacity, while 115 are operating at 100% capacity. Sixty-eight are at a quarter of capacity and 27 are at 75%. \"The chain is benefiting from its booth-style seating and widespread partition installation (now in every restaurant), which can allow operating at nearly full capacity in certain jurisdictions,\" writes Stifel analysts. \"Furthermore, the company has erected temporary patios to further bolster capacity levels where possible.\" Stifel rates Texas Roadhouse shares hold with a $58 price target. \"We estimate the company is retaining about two-thirds of its off-premise sales as dining rooms reopen, a sizable figure that suggests these sales could prove stickier than expected even as restaurants reopen,\" wrote BTIG, which rates Texas Roadhouse shares buy with a $78 price target. Texas Roadhouse stock has rallied 6% for the year to date, and is up nearly 29% over the last three months. The S&P 500 index  is up 2.3% for the period.\n</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

    "description": "<p>Walt Disney Co.  plans to sell access to its long delayed \"Mulan\" live-action movie through Disney+ for $29.99, a new approach to that streaming service, and will launch a new international streaming offering under the Star brand. After the stock languished in after-hours trading following the release of third-quarter earnings, shares jumped to gains of nearly 5% after the twin announcements. Chief Executive Bob Chapek announced the new approaches in a conference call Tuesday afternoon related to Disney's fiscal third-quarter earnings report, which showed a loss of nearly $5 billion due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Disney+ has been used as a subscription service that consumers pay for monthly, but Disney plans to offer a pay-per-view version of \"Mulan\" through the service as of Sept. 4 in most territories that have access to Disney+. Disney will charge $29.99 to view the movie in the U.S., but that price could vary slightly in other countries, and Disney will launch the movie in theaters where they are open, Chapek said. Chapek also said Disney will launch a new streaming service under the Star brand after the success of Disney+, which has surpassed 60 million subscribers. \"Mirroring the strategy we successfully pursued with Disney+, the offering will be rooted in content we own from the prolific and critically acclaimed production engines and libraries of ABC Studios, Fox television, FX, freeform, 20th Century studios and Searchlight,\" Chapek said. \"In many markets, the offering will be fully integrated into our established Disney+ platform from both a marketing and a technology perspective and it will be distributed under the Star brand which has been successfully utilized by the company for other general entertainment platform launches, particularly with Disney+ Hotstar in India.\"</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

    "description": "<p>Gold futures powered higher Tuesday, gathering momentum late in the session to finish at a fresh record as government bond yields headed lower and as the U.S. dollar's recent rebound receded somewhat, allowing the precious metal to make an assault on a record close above the $2,000 threshold. December gold gained $34.70, or 1.7%, to reach $2,021 an ounce. The moves came as a recent rise in the dollar abated, as gauged by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index , a gauge of the greenback against a half-dozen major currencies. The rally for the dollar also came as the 10-year Treasury note yield continued to sink lower, reflecting appetite for haven assets, despite a record climb for equity benchmarks like the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index . The 10-year Treasury note  was recently yielding 0.52%. Lower yields can make gold, which doesn't offer a coupon, comparatively more attractive as a safety play. A weakening dollar, meanwhile, makes dollar-priced assets more appealing to overseas buyers. The sustained rally in gold has come as governments across the world have flooded their economies with financial aid to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. . And investors are betting that the uptrend for the yellow metal continues as the dollar weakens and interest rates remain around 0% in many parts of the world.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

In a letter of resignation, she called on Mayor Bill de Blasio to better leverage city agencies to \"brace against the inevitable second wave.\" Her departure comes amid growing tension, specifically over her stance toward the city's police. The mayor named Dr. Dave A. Chokshi as the new commissioner.

    "description": "<p>Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  soared to fresh records Tuesday after one analyst hiked his price target on the chip company. AMD shares spent Tuesday carving out new intraday records, and were last up 8.5% at $84.30, on track for a new closing record. The stock last closed at a record $78.20 on July 30, fresh from AMD's strong earnings and indications that the company's share gain from Intel Corp.  was quickening. At current levels, AMD is about $1 billion shy of breaking a $100 billion market cap. In a Tuesday note, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis, who has a buy rating on AMD, raised his price target on AMD to $95 from $86. Lipacis said the lead of AMD, and its chip fabricator Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , over Intel appeared \"systemic.\" Lipacis said he expects AMD share gains to accelerate especially in the server market, with an estimated 30% share over the next two to three years, and 50% in four to five years. In its recent earnings call, AMD said it had just reached 10% share of the server market. Of the 36 analysts who cover AMD, 15 have overweight or buy ratings, 18 have hold ratings, and three have sell ratings, with an average price target of $75.76, according to FactSet data. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

An Apple spokesperson told Axios following that report that the company hasn't held discussions about buying TikTok and isn't interested in a deal. Apple didn't immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment. Microsoft Corp.  is considered to be the most logical bidder for TikTok and the company confirmed over the weekend that it would continue discussions about a possible deal. Apple shares are up 0.6% in Tuesday trading, while Microsoft shares are down 2.7%.

Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager commented in the release that Google's acquisition of Fitbit could give the ad giant \"key insights about the life and the health situation of the users of these devices,\" so this investigation \"aims to ensure that control by Google over data collected through wearable devices as a result of the transaction does not distort competition.\" A Reuters report from mid-July said that Google had offered not to use Fitbit health data for the purposes of ad targeting given European Commission concerns. The commission has 90 working days, or until Dec. 9, to reach a decision. Fitbit shares are down 0.4% in Tuesday trading, while Alphabet shares are up 0.3%.
